Tips for running virter on Microsoft Windows images
---------------------------------------------------

Run with at least 4GB RAM (also on image build). Else it is just too slow.
What works is adding --vcpus 2 --memory 4G to vm run / image build commands.

Set ssh_ping_count in virter.toml file to 500.

When creating a VM template make sure to shut it down before pushing it, else
the built-in provisioning would never be run (and vm ssh would not work).

Use the -u switch to configure the SSH user to Administrator (root won't work)
	-u Administrator

Use --vnc to configure graphical GUI access. Also add --vnc-bind-ip 0.0.0.0 if
you want to access it from outside the host.

On image build the provisioning (bash) script must also remove the
/run/cloud-init/result.json file so the provisioning script will be
run on system start up (and configure the correct ssh host keys).

Add:
# make VMs configure host keys when created:
rm /run/cloud-init/result.json
to the provision.toml file.

Sample vm run command:

virter vm run win2019-10 --id 50 --vcpus 2 --memory 4G -u Administrator -w --vnc --vnc-bind-ip 0.0.0.0 -l debug

Sample image build command:

virter image build -p ../provision-ls.toml -u Administrator win2019-8 win2019-10 -l debug --vcpus 2 --memory 4G

Happy hacking :)
